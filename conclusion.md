## Congratulations

Congratulations on completing this Python Data Structures Tutorial! We've covered a lot of ground, from the basics of Stacks, Sets, and Trees, to more advanced topics like tree traversal and hashing.

In the Stacks section, we learned about the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle and how to implement a stack using Python's built-in list data type. We also learned about stack operations such as push, pop, and peek, and how to use a stack to check for balanced parentheses in an expression.

In the Sets section, we learned about the properties of sets and how they are used to store unique elements. We also learned about set operations such as union, intersection, and difference, and how to use a set to find the unique elements in a list.

In the Trees section, we learned about the properties of binary trees and how to implement a binary tree in Python. We also learned about tree traversal methods such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order, and how to use a binary search tree to find the second largest number in the tree.
